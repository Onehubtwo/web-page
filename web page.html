          <p class="aboutme"> Hello, I am a web developer and I have been working since I was 18 years old.
            I started my career as an intern for a big company, where I had to work on projects from scratch.
            After that, I worked for another company that was also open source. There were many different projects, from small to large and from simple to very complex.
            My last job was at a company where we developed own software for customers and also helped them with their problems.

         <h2 class="title" >STUDIES</h2>
         <div>
            <p class="studies">I started learning web development in college where I was taking a course on computer programming and got interested in this area. After coming out of college, i started working in an IT company where i learned many things about programming languages, frameworks and other technologies used in the industry. My job gave me the opportunity to work with different types of people from all around the world which helped me get more experience on different aspects of development such as design and implementation.
            I have taken many courses related to web development like front-end development, back-end development and mobile application development during my training period at an IT company where i was working as a junior programmer. My course at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University helped me gain valuable knowledge about HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript along with some other technologies like AngularJS, Bootstrap and NodeJS which are used by millions
